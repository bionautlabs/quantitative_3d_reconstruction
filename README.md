## Step 1: Organize input

1. Move stitched images to tif folder <br>
2. Create Rxxxxx-metadata.csv file and place it in master rat directory. Columns: <br>
        Rat: rat ID (int) <br>
        Section: section ID (int) <br>
        ToFlip: 1 if current section should be flipped, 0 otherwise <br>

## Step 2: Convert files
#### Reduce RGB images to greyscale & flip images that need flipping
Input folder: ./Rxxxxx/tif <br>
Output folder: modify in place <br>

#### Convert images from tif to jpeg format for QuickNII
Change file naming order to Rxxxxx-chz-syyy.jpg <br>
Input folder: ../Rxxxx/tif/ <br>
Output folder: ../Rxxxx/QuickNII/jpeg/ <br>

#### Convert images from tif to h5 for Ilastik
For DAPI staining of tissue, keep single channel DAPI images <br>
For GFP/mCherry visualization of virus+ cells, merge three channel images, e.g. BF-GFP-DAPI <br>


```python
import pipeline
```


```python
# Define rat ID
rat = 12345
```


```python
# Extract image metadata from tif file names
df_meta = pipeline.extract_metadata_all_images(rat)

# Reduce RGB images to greyscale & flip images that need flipping
#pipeline.flip_images(df_meta)

# Convert images from tif to jpeg format for QuickNII
pipeline.convert_for_quickNII(df_meta)

# Convert images from tif to h5 for Ilastik
pipeline.convert_to_h5(df_meta,channel='DAPI')
pipeline.merge_h5_all_sections(df_meta,main_channel='GFP',    channels_to_merge=['BF','GFP','DAPI'])
pipeline.merge_h5_all_sections(df_meta,main_channel='mCherry',channels_to_merge=['BF','mCherry','DAPI'])
```

## Step 3: Ilastik Segmentation
#### Training guidelines:
Use h5 format for training and batch processing <br>
Select ~10% of the data representing a wide range of signal and background/signal "phenotypes" <br>
At first, select all features <br>
In training, first label a few representative objects and click on "Suggest Features" <br>
Identify at least 7 top features <br>
Train the model using the suggested features only <br>
#### DAPI (tissue) specific guidelines
Files: 1-channel DAPI h5 files <br>
Labels: Tissue & Background (BG) <br>
#### GFP/mCherry (virus+ cell) specific guidelines
Files: 3-channel BF-GFP/mCherry-DAPI h5 files <br>
Labels: GFP/mCherry, Background (BG) & Damage (DMG) <br>
#### Batch processing guidelines
Batch processing output settings: Format=SimpleSegmentation Filetype=TIF <br>
Output files will be saved in the folder with input h5 files <br>
Move them to ../IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL/ <br>

## Step 4: Ilastik Output Processing
#### General guidelines
Remove redundant phrases from output file names <br>
Remove small objects and close small holes (adjust thresholds as needed) <br>
Rescale so that objects are now 255 (not 1) <br>
Input folder: ..Rxxxxx//IlasktikSegmentation/CHANNEL/ <br>
Output folder ..Rxxxxx//CHANNEL-processed/ <br>
#### DAPI (tissue) mask processing
Holes and small objects are relatively large, set thresholds accordingly <br>
To detect capsule hole, an alphashape will be drawn around tissue mask, and the mask will be inverted <br>
Manually marked image will be used to identify capsule hole <br>
#### GFP/mCherry (drug) mask processing
Holes and small objects are relatively small, set thresholds accordingly <br>
Optionally, overlay processed tissue masks to remove objects outside of the tissue <br>
#### Needle/Capsule hole detection
Find images where needle/capsule holes are visible (starting images must be greyscale) <br>
For needle condition: paint over the entire track in blue & save in DrawNeedleTrack subdir. Use function find_needle_track. <br>
For capsule condition: make a small mark on the capsule hole(s) in blue & save in MarkCapsuleHole subdir. Use function find_capsule_hole. <br>
Input folder (needle): ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/DrawNeedleTrack <br>
Input folder (capsule):../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/MarkCapsuleHole & ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/DAPI-processed <br>
Output folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/Hole <br>


```python
pipeline.process_tissue_masks(rat)
pipeline.find_needle_track(rat)
pipeline.process_drug_masks(rat,channel='GFP',    remove_from_name='_Simple Segmentation')
pipeline.process_drug_masks(rat,channel='mCherry',remove_from_name='_Simple Segmentation')
```

## Step 5: Calculate Object Properties
Calculate object properties for processed drug masks and normalize them <br>
Key properties: X and Y spatial coordinates & spatial moment (along with metadata) <br>
Save results as csv file in master rat directory <br>
Input folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-processed/ <br>
Output dir: ../Rxxxxx/Rxxxxx-CHANNEL-ObjectProps.csv <br>


```python
pipeline.get_object_props_all_sections(rat,channel='GFP')
pipeline.get_object_props_all_sections(rat,channel='mCherry')
```

## Step 6: Process Seed Sections for DBSCAN
#### Identify seed sections
Seed sections will serve as starting points for object clustering <br>
At the minimum, select a single seed section at the center of the virus+ cell cloud <br>
The remaining sections will then be clustered starting at the center and towards the tails of the cloud <br>
If necessary, additional sections can be selected <br>
If virus+ cell cloud ends before the sections are exhausted, also select the first section where virus+ cell cloud is no longer visble <br>
#### Manually "cluster" seed sections
To manually "cluster" seed sections, open greyscale images in FIJI <br>
Black out areas outside of the true positive cloud (i.e. pixel value = 0) <br>
Fully black out the first image where virus+ cell cloud is no longer visible <br>
Save manually "clustered" images in '../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-seed/ folder <br>
#### Combine processed drug masks and manually "clustered" seed sections
In processed drug masks, remove objects that lie outside of the virus+ cell cloud, i.e. in the blaced out regions <br>
Save the final masks and update csv file with object props with TruePositive object assignment <br>
Input folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-seed/ <br>
Output folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-final/ <br>
File to modify in place: ../Rxxxxx/Rxxxxx-CHANNEL-ObjectProps.csv <br>


```python
pipeline.process_seed_masks(rat,channel='GFP')
pipeline.process_seed_masks(rat,channel='mCherry')
```

## Step 7: Cluster Objects with DBSCAN
#### Cluster objects iteratively
Specify rat, channel, center seed section ID <br>
Optimize clustering parameters as needed <br>
Input folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-seed/ (seed sections only) <br>
File to modify in place: ../Rxxxxx/Rxxxxx-CHANNEL-ObjectProps.csv <br>
#### Optionally, visualize clustering results
Input file: ../Rxxxxx/Rxxxxx-CHANNEL-ObjectProps.csv <br>
Output folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-DBSCAN/VERSION/ <br>
Example version: 'i3D', i.e. iterative 3D DBSCAN <br>


```python
# Run iterative 3D DBSCAN
pipeline.run_idb_all_sections(rat,'GFP',90)
# Optionally, visualize clustering results for visual inspection
pipeline.plot_spatial_features_all_sections(rat,channel='GFP',
                                            label_clusters=True,clusterCol='TruePositive',version='i3D')
```


```python
# Run iterative 3D DBSCAN
pipeline.run_idb_all_sections(rat,'mCherry',108)
# Optionally, visualize clustering results for visual inspection
pipeline.plot_spatial_features_all_sections(rat,channel='mCherry',
                                            label_clusters=True,clusterCol='TruePositive',version='i3D')
```

## Step 8: Remove Noise
#### Remove false positive objects identified during clustering
Input file: ../Rxxxxx/Rxxxxx-CHANNEL-ObjectProps.csv <br>
Input folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-processed/ <br>
Output folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-final/ <br>
#### Optionally, reduct true positive object masks to centroid pixels
Reducing objects to centroid pixels speeds up and simplifies Nutil step <br>
Input folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-final/ <br>
Output folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-final-centroid/ <br>


```python
# Remove false positives
pipeline.process_drug_masks_final(rat,channel='GFP')
pipeline.process_drug_masks_final(rat,channel='mCherry')

# Reduce objects to centroid pixels
pipeline.generate_centroid_masks(rat,channel='GFP')
pipeline.generate_centroid_masks(rat,channel='mCherry')
```

## Step 9: Align Sections to Brain Atlas in QuickNII
See QuickNII documentation

## Step 10: Apply Alignment to Final Masks
See Nutil documentation
#### Needle/Capsule hole masks
Use masks as is in png format
#### Drug masks
To save on computation, use centroid masks in png format

## Step 11: Extract Quantitative Information
##### Predict virus+ cell counts in missing sections and total virus+ cell counts in the brain
Smooth raw counts across sections using 1D Gaussian filter <br>
Then use linear inerpolation between each pair of consecutive analyzed sections to predict virus+ cell counts in missing sections in between <br>
Sum up section counts to estimate total virus+ cell count in the brain <br>
Input folder: ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-final/ OR <br>
              ../Rxxxxx/IlastikSegmentation/CHANNEL-final-centroid/ <br>
#### Estimate virus+ cell cloud volume and profile virus+ cell distribution from boundary of drug delivery
Extract data from Nutil output <br>
Draw alphashape around needle/capsule/hole pixels to obtain boundary of drug delivery (optimize alpha param as needed) <br>
Draw alphashape around point cloud to estimate cloud volume (optimize alpha param as needed) <br>
Use Trimesh PointCloud to profile virus+ cell distance from drug delivery boundary as ECDF <br>
Input: ../Rxxxxx/Nutil/ with subfolders CHANNEL OR CHANNEL-centroid and Needle OR Capsule OR Hole <br>


```python
# Estimate virus+ cells across sections and in whole brain
df_section_counts, df_total_counts = pipeline.predict_counts_exp([rat],['GFP','mCherry'],centroid=True)
```


```python
# Profile distrubution of virus+ cell distance from boundary of drug delivery as ecdf
# Calculate oveall spatial parameters: volume, distance 50th and 95th percentiles
df_ecdf, df_overall = pipeline.analyze_distribution([rat],['GFP','mCherry'],reference_name='Needle')
pipeline.plot_ecdf(df_ecdf,channels=['GFP','mCherry'],labels=['AdV','AAV1'])
```

## Optionally, Validate Virus+ Cell Counts


```python
# Validate how total virus+ cell number estimate depends on sampling rate
total_counts_validation = pipeline.validate_total_counts(rat,channel='mCherry',centroid=True)
pipeline.plot_total_count_validation(total_counts_validation)
```


```python
# Validation how predicted per-section virus+ cell number compares to actual per-section counts
section_counts_validation = pipeline.validate_section_counts(rat,channel='mCherry',centroid=True)
pipeline.plot_section_count_validation(section_counts_validation)
```

## Optionally, Compute Performance Metrics
GroundTruth Masks: ../Rxxxxx/ROIs/GroundTruth/ <br>
Model: ../Rxxxxx/ROIs/MODEL/ <br>
Model examples: CellProfiler, Ilastik1ch, Ilastik3ch <br>


```python
df_performance_counts = pipeline.count_objects(rat,models=['Ilastik1ch','Ilastik3ch','CellProfiler1ch'])
df_metrics = pipeline.calc_metrics(df_performance_counts,groupingCols=['Rat','Channel','Model'])
```
